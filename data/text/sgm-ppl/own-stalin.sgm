<BODY>Among the Bolshevik revolutionaries who took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917, Stalin was appointed general secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1922. He subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through suppressing Lenin's criticisms (in the postscript of his testament) and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition.</BODY>

<BODY>Under Stalin's rule, the concept of "socialism in one country" became a central tenet of Soviet society. He replaced the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin in the early 1920s with a highly centralised command economy, launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power.</BODY>

<BODY>The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932â€“1933, known as the Holodomor in Ukraine. Later, in a period that lasted from 1936 to 1939, Stalin instituted a campaign against alleged enemies within his regime, called the Great Purge, in which hundreds of thousands were executed. </BODY>

This led to the Georgian Affair of 1922 and other repressions.[18][19] Stalin's actions in Georgia created a rift with Lenin, who believed that all the Soviet states should stand equal.</BODY>
