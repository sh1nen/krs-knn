      <author>By Martin Cherrin Reuters</author>
      <dateline>NEW YORK March</dateline>
      <body>Quarter point prime rate increases to pct by Citibank Chase Manhattan Bank today be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs Federal Reserve s policy intentions economists Based on spread between banks cost funds prime rate probably makes sense others to follow but no rush likely Paul McCulley E F Hutton Co Citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by Chase sent U S bond prices lower dollar higher McCulley once spread between three month certificates deposit prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there strong chance prime rate increase been under points recently However banks likely to hold rate increases until they see what Fed intends to do interest rates near term analysts They noted banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements rather than lead them example prime rate increase occurred June when banks lifted rate to pct pct after Fed discount rate increase April year Major banks been posting pct prime rate since August when they lowered rate eight pct shortly after Fed s half point discount rate cut to current pct level on August The banks rush to raise their prime rates There should be split prime while some posting pct rate others pct David Jones Aubrey G Lanston Co Jones Federal Open Market Committee at today s meeting voted no change Fed policy But he Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon Jones while FOMC probably voted no policy change today may decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or economy shows sign strong recovery The Fed clearly indicated they did intend to tighten policy when they did today s coupon pass Joseph Liro S G Warburg Co move came day earlier than most expected Fed today supplied permanent reserves to banking system by offering to buy all maturities Treasury notes bonds own account seasonal reserve add called pass The Fed demonstrated there been no policy change Elizabeth Reiners economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc She spread between banks cost funds prime rate now around basis points compared basis point average Reiners spread really narrow enough to present clear need prime rate increase Dean Witter economist today s prime rate rise may been less response to interest rates than attempt to enhance balance sheet bottom line Reiners given recent problems loans to developing countries large money center banks heavy exposures might be first to match higher prime rate effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans Federal funds rate at banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match higher prime rate also how quickly they move raising their prime rates banks cited higher cost funds three business days through Monday Federal funds rate at banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct But quarter end pressures helped push up funds Fed funds rate extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated end quarter close Japanese fiscal year Funds traded between five pct Once special distortions end analysts funds rate probably return to recent trading level pct area They if stabilizes near there banks may quickly boost their prime rates But consistently higher funds rates suggest to many Fed fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help dollar Then banks lift prime rates quickly</body>
